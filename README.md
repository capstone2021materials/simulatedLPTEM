written by Lehan Yao  
used to generate synthetic liquid phase TEM images.  
Matlab version: R2019a
1. unzip /functions/eigen
2. use Matlab to compile 3 cpp or c files in /functions
3. run simulation.mlapp  
To generate your own MTF, replace the video/image in /MTF maker/MTF_concavecube.m and run the script  
The generated MTF data should be copied to /MTF data
